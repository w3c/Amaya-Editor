			XML::Parser Version 2.23

All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The expat distribution is included in full in
this distribution in the directory Expat/expat.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

This is a beta version and there's resistance to making radical API
changes at this time, but minor, evolutionary changes may occur as I get
feedback from the people on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com.]

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install
