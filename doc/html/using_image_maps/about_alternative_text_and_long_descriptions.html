<h1>About Alternative Text and Long Descriptions</h1>

<p>Without useful alternative text for images, many web pages become
difficult or even impossible to navigate, and users are left “feeling their
way in the dark.”</p>

<p>To prevent this problem, you must provide alternative text for elements
such as images and other multimedia objects. The alternative text is usually
presented instead of the image by a browser with a voice output system, or on
a Braille display used by many people who are blind.  It is also common for
users with low-quality connections to request the alternate view, because
text is transmitted much faster than images.</p>

<p>The alternative text should replace the image in function as well. For
example, if you use the image as an icon that links to a reference point (the
first link on this page, to the W3C home page, is such a link), then the
title of the reference itself is a good alternative text.</p>

<p>There are cases where an image is used for purely visual effect, and does
not add any information value to the page. In this case, it is appropriate to
use a blank alternative text, although you must still define it by entering
two double quotes for the alternative text (for example,
<code>alt=""</code>).</p>

<p>When the image conveys important information that is not available from
the text of the document, you must provide a description of the information.
The longdesc option (Attributes &gt; longdesc) enables you to link a
description to the image. This description can be a URI (a separate
document), or named part of the current document.</p>

<p>To view how a page might be presented without the images, use Show
Alternate (<span class="Link0">Views &gt;Show Alternate</span>). If the page
is spoken by a voice output system, then the alternate view might simply be
read out.</p>
