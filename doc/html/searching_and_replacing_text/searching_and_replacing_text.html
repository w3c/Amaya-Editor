<h1>Searching and Replacing Text</h1>

<p>You can search and replace text with the <strong>Search</strong> dialog by
choosing <strong>Find</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or
clicking the <strong>Search</strong> button <img src="../icons/find.gif"
alt="Search button">. You can also use the keyboard shortcut:
<code>Control-Shift-%</code> in Unix, or <code>Control-F </code>in
Windows.</p>

<p>This dialog enables you to search or replace text using different
criteria:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>You must enter the character string for which you want to search in the
    <strong>Search for</strong> field.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>If the <strong>UPPER=lower</strong> button is selected, a
    case-insensitive search is performed; otherwise, the string is searched
    for as it appears within the <strong>Search for</strong> field.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Strings can also be replaced using the same operation. You enter the
    replacement text in the <strong>Replace by</strong> field and select a
    replacement mode from the <strong>Replace</strong> box. The replacement
    modes are:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No replace</strong>: No replacement occurs even if the
        Replace field contains a character string. It is just a simple
      search.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace on request</strong>: When the string is found,
        Amaya selects it. The user can then click one of the following
        buttons:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Confirm</strong> to replace and carry out the search
            again.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not replace</strong> to search for the next instance
            without replacing the string that was found.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Automatic replace</strong>: All instances of the
        searched-for string are automatically replaced within the portion of
        document defined in the <strong>Search where</strong> box.
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Search where</strong> box enables you to specify the part
    of document in which the search will occur:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before selection</strong>: The search starts at the
        beginning of the selected part and moves backward to the beginning of
        the document.</li>
      <li><strong>Within selection</strong>: The search only occurs within
        the selected part, from its beginning to its end.</li>
      <li><strong>After selection</strong>: The search starts at the end of
        the selected part and moves forward to the end of the document.</li>
      <li><strong>In the whole document</strong>: The search is carried out
        in the whole document from the beginning to the end regardless of
        which part is selected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To initiate the search operation, click the <strong>Confirm</strong>
button at the bottom of the dialog. If Amaya finds the searched-for string,
it is selected and the document is positioned so as to make this string
visible. You can then search for the next instance of this string by clicking
the <strong>Confirm</strong> button again. If the string is not found, Amaya
displays a <strong>Not found</strong> message in the bottom right corner of
the dialog.</p>

<p>Search or replace can be abandoned at any time by clicking the
<strong>Done</strong> button.</p>

<p>Replacement operations can be undone by choosing <strong>Undo</strong>
from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut
<code>Control-Z</code>.</p>
