<h1>Spell Checking</h1>

<p>Amaya provides a multilingual spell checker, and selects the appropriate
language according to the <code>LANG</code> attribute. The <code>LANG</code>
attribute can be associated with any element in a document, even with a
single word, by choosing <strong>Language</strong> from the
<strong>Attributes</strong> menu.</p>

<p>To spell check a document, choose <strong>Spell Check</strong> from the
<strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>

<h2>The Personal Dictionary</h2>

<p>When you register a new word, the spell checker creates or updates the
<b>user's personal dictionary</b>. A user's personal dictionary is located in
the <code>AmayaHome/dictionary.DCT</code> file. In read-write mode, the spell
checker employs the user dictionary when reviewing all documents, in addition
to the language-specific dictionary. When you click the <strong>Skip
(+dic)</strong> and <strong>Replace (+dic)</strong> buttons in the
<strong>Spell Checking</strong> dialog, the user dictionary is created and
automatically updated by the spelling checker.</p>

<h2>The Spell Check Dialog</h2>

<p>The <strong>Spell Check</strong> option on the <strong>Edit</strong> menu
displays a dialog that enables you to choose parameters and interact with the
spell checker. These parameters are defined below.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Number of proposals</strong> field defines the maximum number
    of proposed corrections: any value between 1 and 10, the default value is
    3. When an error is detected, any change made to this value immediately
    displays a new list of corrections.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Ignore</strong> section tells the spell checker to ignore
    certain words, for example, words that contain capital letters, digits,
    Roman numerals or special characters.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Checking</strong> section, similar to that in the Search
    dialog, enables you to specify the part of document on which the checker
    will work.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Spell Checking</strong> field displays incorrect words. The
    list of proposed corrections is displayed in the selector field located
    below the incorrect word. By default, Amaya selects the first proposed
    correction. To select another correction, simply click it. The selected
    correction is displayed below the selector field. This correction can be
    directly edited on the form. The correction is made when you click the
    <strong>Replace and next</strong> or <strong>Replace (+dic)</strong>
    buttons.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>language</strong> in which the correction is made is
    specified in the top left corner of the form. To change the language,
    apply a Language attribute to the text with the
    <strong>Attributes</strong> menu, and restart the spell-check
  procedure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the Spell Checker</h2>

<p>To start the checker, click the <strong>Search/Skip</strong> button at the
bottom of the form. If an error is found, the incorrect word is selected and
highlighted in the document. If no error was detected, Amaya displays the
<b>Not found</b> message in the bottom right corner of the form.</p>

<p>When an incorrect word is detected, you can use a button on the form to
perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Done</strong>: Amaya closes the form and stops spell checking.
    Previous corrections are not canceled.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Search/Skip</strong>: Amaya considers the incorrect word as
    acceptable. No change is made in the text or in the dictionaries. The
    checker searches for the next error.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Skip+Next</strong>: Amaya considers the incorrect word as
    acceptable, and the checker moves on to the next word.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Skip (+dic)</strong>: Performs the same action as the
    <strong>Skip+Next</strong> button, except that the word considered
    incorrect is added to the  document dictionary, and the checker will
    ignore any subsequent occurrence of this word.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Replace and Next</strong>: Amaya replaces the incorrect word
    with the correct word (optionally edited by the user) and the checker
    searches for the next error.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Replace (+dic):</strong> Performs the same action as the
    <strong>Replace and Next</strong> button, except that the replacement
    word is added to the document dictionary.</li>
</ul>
