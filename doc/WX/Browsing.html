<h2 id="Browsing">Browsing with Amaya</h2>

<p>Amaya is mainly an editor with browsing capabilities. It allows you to
edit and browse Web documents simultaneously. Browsing with Amaya is similar
to browsing with other Web browsers except for <a
href="#Activating">activating a Link</a> and <a href="#Using">using
forms</a>.</p>

<p>Amaya allows you to to display and edit HTML documents as well as some XML
document types: XHTML, MathML (mathematical expressions) and SVG (gaphics).
It also allows you to access other XML document types and to display their
content according to attached CSS style sheets. For these XML documents some
editing functions are available.</p>

<h3 id="Activating1">Activating a Link</h3>

<p>Links are usually displayed in blue. Because Amaya is both a browser and
an editor, you get different results when you single-click, double-click, or
right-click a link.</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>Single-click</kbd> a link to move the cursor to that position in
    the document. The status bar displays the expanded URI of the link. You
    can now edit the content of the link.</li>
  <li><kbd>Double-click</kbd> a link to activate it and skip to its target.
    The document retrieved by this operation replaces the current document in
    the same tab as the original document. If the original document was
    modified and has not been saved yet, a dialog box is displayed. It allows
    you to save the changes you have made before replacing the original
    document.</li>
  <li><kbd>Right-click</kbd> a link (or <kbd>Cmd + Single-click</kbd> on
    MacOS X) to activate the link and open the target document in a new tab
    or a new window (a pop-up menu allows you to choose).</li>
</ul>

<p class="Note">This behavior can be changed through the
<strong>Browsing</strong> tab under the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog.
By changing the option <strong>Double click activates link</strong>, you can
browse documents with a single click as you would in a traditional Web
browser. However, you will not be able to edit the content of a link by
clicking it, but you can move the cursor within a link with the arrow
keys.<br />
Other browsing preferences such as whether images should be loaded or not,
whether CSS style sheets should be applied or not, can be set in the
<strong>Browsing Preferences</strong> <a
href="Configure.html#Browsing">dialog</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use the keyboard to select links and to activate them. Key
<kbd>Tab</kbd> allows you to move to the next link or form field in the
document. <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> allows you to move to the previous link or
form field. <kbd>Alt &darr;</kbd> activates the current link. You can choose
<a href="ShortCuts.html">other keys</a> to perform these commands.</p>

<h3 id="Access">Access Keys</h3>

<p>Access keys provide shortcuts for moving the cursor to a form field, an
area, or a link. This kind of access is crucial to people with motor
disabilities, but there are other conditions where it could be necessary or
useful.</p>

<p>When developing a web document, you can associate the
<code>accesskey</code> attribute with the following elements: <code>a</code>,
<code>area</code>, <code>button</code>, <code>input</code>,
<code>label</code>, <code>legend</code>, and <code>textarea</code>.</p>

<p>For example, if you associate the <code>accesskey</code> attribute with a
link in a document using <code>accesskey="n"</code> or
<code>accesskey="N"</code>, command <kbd>Alt accesskey</kbd> (<kbd>Alt
n</kbd> or <kbd>Alt N</kbd>) will activate that link (on MacOS X, use
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> instead if <kbd>Alt</kbd>). If you associate the
<code>accesskey</code> attribute to a form element, pressing <kbd>Alt
accesskey</kbd> moves the focus to that element (or to the following element
if associated with a <code>label</code> or <code>legend</code> element).</p>

<p>Access keys overwrite Amaya shortcuts, but not the system shortcuts
(menus, for instance).</p>

<p>As an example, these Help pages declare the following access keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"n" for going to the next page</li>
  <li>"p" for going to the previous page</li>
  <li>"t" for the table of contents</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have assigned the shortcut <kbd>Alt-p</kbd> to an Amaya command,
this shortcut won't be work in an Amaya Help pages; it will display the
previous page instead.</p>

<p>By default, Amaya uses the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key as the modifier for access
keys (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on MacOS X). However, you can change this default using
the<strong></strong><strong>Edit&gt;Preferences&gt;General</strong> dialog
box. You can choose the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key instead of the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key
for a modifier, or you can disable the access key mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="Target">Target Anchors</h3>

<p>Targets are elements that have been given an <code>id</code> attribute or
anchors (element <code>a</code>) that have been given a <code>name</code>
attribute. They identify possible targets for links.</p>

<p>You can easily recognize targets and set links to them: Amaya allows you
to display target icons <img src="../images/target.gif" alt="Target icon" />
in front of all targets. These icons are not part of the document and can be
displayed or hidden in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing <strong>Show targets</strong> from the <strong>Views</strong>
    menu.</li>
  <li>Using the default keyboard command (<kbd>Ctrl u Ctrl t</kbd>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Opening">Opening Documents</h3>

<p>You can open both local or remote documents in several different ways:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>File menu</dt>
    <dd><ol>
        <li>Choose <strong>Open document</strong> from the
          <strong>File</strong> menu. 
          <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can alternately use a
          keyboard shortcut to open a document. Press <kbd>Ctrl o ctrl
          o</kbd>. You can also right-click the tab of any open document.</p>
        </li>
        <li>In the <strong>Open document</strong> dialog, type the full path
          or URI of the file you want to open, or use the
          <strong>File</strong> or <strong>Directory</strong> buttons to open
          a file selection dialog. 
          <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also click the
          button on the right side of the address field to display the list
          of the documents you have opened recently. You can then select an
          address in this list to open the corresponding document.</p>
        </li>
        <li>When the document is correctly specified, click
          <strong>Open.</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can also use these steps to create a new local document, by
      specifying the name of a file that does not exist.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Files explorer</dt>
    <dd>A files explorer is displayed at the top of Tools window. This tool
      gives access to all local directories. A simple click allows one to
      open or close a directory and a double click on a file name opens the
      corresponding document.</dd>
  <dt>Document address field</dt>
    <dd>The address of the current document is displayed at the top of the
      window. Edit this address to specify the file name or the URI of the
      document you want to open and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. 
      <p>You can also create a new document by typing the name of a document
      that does not exist yet.</p>
      <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also click the button on
      the right side of the document address field to display the list of the
      documents you have opened recently. You can then select an address in
      this list to open the corresponding document.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Hypertext links</dt>
    <dd>By <a href="#Activating1">activating a link</a> you load the target
      document.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Note about character sets</strong></p>

<p>Amaya reads HTML and XHTML documents differently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amaya reads HTML documents by default as <a
    href="EditChar.html">ISO-Latin-1</a> files. If an author does not provide
    information about the character set (charset) in the HTTP header or in a
    META element, Amaya considers an HTML document to be encoded in
    ISO-Latin-1. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Amaya reads XHTML documents by default as UTF-8 files. If an author
    does not provide information about the charset in the HTTP header, in the
    XML declaration, or in a META element, Amaya considers an XHTML document
    to be encoded in UTF-8.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the default charset is different for HTML and XHTML documents,
authors often create documents using the incorrect charset. For example,
consider an XHTML document that uses ISO-Latin-1 but does not provide
information about the charset. When the XML parser analyzing the document
encounters a character that does not match a valid UTF-8 character, the
document is considered to be not well formed. Parsing stops and Amaya
displays an error message that proposes either to reload the document as an
HTML document or to show parsing errors. If show parsing errors is selected,
Amaya displays the detected errors.</p>

<h3 id="Moving">Moving Backward and Forward</h3>

<p>Amaya creates a history list to keep track of the pages you have viewed in
the current session. You can move backward or forward through pages in the
history list in several ways:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>File menu</td>
      <td>Choose <strong>Back</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to
        view the previous page. 

        <p>Choose <strong>Forward</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
        menu to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Keyboard shortcuts</td>
      <td><p>Press <kbd>Alt &lt;-</kbd> to view the previous page.</p>

        <p>Press <kbd>Alt -&gt;</kbd> to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Button bar</td>
      <td>Click the <img alt="Back "
        src="../../resources/icons/22x22/back.png" align="middle" /> button
        to view the previous page. 

        <p>Click the <img alt="Forward "
        src="../../resources/icons/22x22/forward.png" align="middle" />
        button to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that each tab has a separate history.</p>

<h3 id="Reloading">Reloading a page</h3>

<p>Documents can be reloaded by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing <strong>Reload document</strong> from the
    <strong>File</strong> menu.</li>
  <li>Using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl r</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Clicking the <strong>Reload</strong> button <img
    src="../../resources/icons/22x22/reload.png" alt="reload" align="middle"
    /> on the button bar.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Using">Using forms</h2>

<p>As Amaya is a browser/editor, some of the widgets associated with HTML
form elements are different from those you are used to in browsers. This
section mentions the most notable differences.</p>

<h3 id="Simple">Simple menus</h3>

<p>To activate a selector such as this one:  
<select name="fruit">
  <option selected="selected">apple</option>
  <option>orange</option>
  <option>lemon</option>
  <option>banana</option>
  <option>strawberry</option>
</select>
 , you have to click twice on the entry ("apple" here). This will result in a
popup widget appearing showing all the entries. The widget supports a user
interaction both with the keyboard as well as with the mouse.</p>

<p>With the keyboard, you must first select an entry using the arrow keys.
Pressing the <strong>Enter</strong> key validates the choice. You can abort
the action of this widget by pressing the <code>Esc</code> key anytime.</p>

<p>With the mouse, there are two kinds of behavior. A single click allows you
to select an entry, whereas a double click on an entry means that you want to
activate the selection. To abort the action of the widget, you just need to
click in any area outside of the pop-up widget. With very long menus, you can
also use the scroll bar to quickly navigate thru the widget entries.</p>

<h3 id="Menus">Menus with multiple selections</h3>

<p>Some menus, like this one : 
<select name="fruit" multiple="multiple">
  <option>apple</option>
  <option>orange</option>
  <option selected="selected">lemon</option>
  <option selected="selected">banana</option>
  <option>strawberry</option>
</select>
 allow multiple entries to be selected simultaneously. The behavior of this
widget is similar to the single selection one. That is, the widget supports
only one toggle of a selection state at the time. You need to invoke it as
many times as toggle changes you need. When the widget is activated, it shows
the current state of selections. As before, you can abort the widget by using
either the <code>Esc</code> key or clicking elsewhere.</p>
