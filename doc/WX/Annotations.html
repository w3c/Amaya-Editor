<h2 id="Annotation">Annotations</h2>

<h3 id="What">What is an annotation?</h3>

<p>Annotations are comments, notes, explanations, or other types of external
remarks that can be attached to a Web document or a selected part of the
document. As they are external, it is possible to annotate any Web document
independently, without needing to edit that document. From the technical
point of view, annotations are usually seen as <strong>metadata,</strong> as
they give additional information about an existing piece of data. In this
project, we use a special <strong><a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a></strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns">annotation schema</a> for
describing annotations.</p>

<p>Annotations can be stored locally or in one or more <em>annotation
servers</em>. When a document is browsed, Amaya queries each of these
servers, requesting the annotations related to that document. Currently Amaya
presents annotations with pencil annotation icons   that are visually
embedded in the document. If the user single-clicks on an annotation icon,
the text that was annotated is highlighted. If the user double-clicks on this
icon, the annotation text and other metadata are presented in a separate
window.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> </p>

<p>An annotation has many properties including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical location: is the annotation stored in a local file system or
    in an annotation server</li>
  <li>Scope: is the annotation associated to a whole document or just to a
    fragment of this document</li>
  <li>Annotation type: 'Annotation', 'Comment', 'Query', ...</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="About">Local and remote annotations</h3>

<p>Amaya can store annotation data in a <span>local file system</span> (often
called <em>local annotations</em>) or it can store annotations remotely, in
Annotations Servers accessed through the World Wide Web (called <em>remote
annotations</em>).</p>

<p>You do not need a server to create local annotations. Local annotations
are stored under the user <a href="Configure.html#AmayaHome">AmayaHome</a>
directory, in a special directory called <code>annotations</code>, and can be
seen only by their owner (according to the system access right setup).</p>

<p>This directory contains three kinds of files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>annot.index:</code> Associates URLs with the files containing the
    metadata of the annotations.</li>
  <li><code>index + random suffix:</code> Stores the metadata of the
    annotations related to a given URL. The metadata is specified with RDF.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><code>annot + random suffix.html:</code> Contains the body of an
    annotation, stored as XHTML.</li>
</ul>

<p>At any time, you can convert a <em>local annotation</em> to a shared one
by choosing <strong>Post to server</strong> from the
<strong>Tools/Annotations</strong> submenu. Once this is completed, the local
annotation is deleted because it has been moved to an annotation server.</p>

<h4 id="Remote">Remote annotations</h4>

<p>You can store <em>remote annotations</em> in annotation servers so that
the annotations can be downloaded by anyone having the correct access rights,
such as is the case of other HTML documents.</p>

<p>Remote annotations are referred to as shared or public annotations,
because they can be seen by other people. If you wish to install your own
annotation server, please refer to <span style="color:blue"><a
href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/26-modules/User/Annotations-HOWTO.html">Annotation-Server-HOWTO</a></span>.</p>

<h3 id="Creating">Creating an annotation</h3>

<p>This version of Amaya supports two kinds of annotations: annotations that
apply to a whole document and annotations that apply to a specific point or
selection in a document.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To annotate an entire document, choose <strong>Annotate
    document</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong> menu. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>To annotate a point, put the insertion point at any place in the
    document and choose <strong>Annotate selection</strong> from the
    <strong>Tools/Annotations</strong> submenu. </li>
  <li>To annotate a selection, make a selection in the document and choose
    <strong>Annotate selection</strong> from the
    <strong>Tools/Annotations</strong> submenu.</li>
</ul>

<p>After any of these options are performed, an annotation document  is
displayed, with inital annotation metadata and an empty body of the
annotation.</p>

<p>Currently, the metadata consists of the <strong>author's name</strong>,
<strong>title</strong> of the annotated document, <strong>annotation
type</strong>, <strong>creation date</strong>, and <strong>last modification
date</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the metadata fields have special properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Source document</strong> field is a link that points back
    to the annotated text. If the user double-clicks it, as when following
    any other link with Amaya, the annotated document will be displayed with
    the annotated text highlighted.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Annotation types</strong> field lets you classify the
    annotation and change its type. Double-click on the text
    <strong>Annotation type</strong> to see the list of types available.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Last modified</strong> field is updated automatically each
    time that an annotation is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below the header area is the annotation body area. It shows the current
content and can be edited like any other HTML document.</p>

<h3 id="Saving">Saving an annotation</h3>

<p>Saving an annotation is the same as saving any other document with Amaya:
choose <span class="Link"><strong>Save</strong></span>from the
<strong>File</strong> menu (or use its equivalent shortcut or button).</p>

<p>Local annotations are saved to the annotations directory and remote
annotations are saved to the annotation post server, where they are stored if
the user has write access.</p>

<p>To convert a local annotation into a shared one, choose <strong>Post
Annotation</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong> menu to save the
annotation to the Post server as defined in the <span
class="Link"><strong>Configuration for Annotations</strong> dialog</span>. If
this operation is successful, the local annotation will be removed and future
<strong>Save</strong> operations will go directly to that annotation
server.</p>

<p>Some commands that can be applied to a document in the Amaya document
window also can be applied to an annotation document in the Annotation
window. For example, the body of an annotation can be printed by choosing
<strong>Print</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu, or reloaded by
choosing <strong>Reload document</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
menu.</p>

<h3 id="Deleting">Deleting an annotation</h3>

<p>The <strong>Delete</strong> command on the <strong>Annotation</strong>
menu enables you to delete an annotation. You can invoke this command from an
open annotation window.</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To delete an annotation from a document:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the annotation by clicking the annotation icon.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Delete</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong>
    menu.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Loading">Loading and presenting annotations</h3>

<p>The <strong>Load Annotations</strong> command tells Amaya to load the
annotations that are associated with the URL of the current document. Amaya
will query the annotation servers, using the settings from the
<strong>Configuration for annotations</strong> dialog, and ask for any
relevant annotation.</p>

<p>Annotations can also be loaded automatically whenever a new page is viewed
by selecting the <strong>Autoload Annotations</strong> check box in the
<strong>Configuration for annotations</strong> dialog.</p>

<p>In this version of Amaya, querying an annotation server will return all
the annotations that are associated with a document. In a future version, it
may be possible to use a customized query menu to refine the query string
that is sent to the servers.</p>

<h3 id="Annotation2">The annotation local filter menu</h3>

<p>Choose <strong>Local filter</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong>
menu to show or hide the annotation icons in the document window. You can
show or hide annotations by three types of metadata: the name of the
annotation's author, the type of annotation, and the annotation server
name.</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To apply any of these filters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the text box to select an annotation type.</li>
  <li>Click the corresponding action button. The <strong>Show all</strong>
    and <strong>Hide all</strong> buttons apply to all the annotations.</li>
  <li>A small prefix character indicates the status of a given entry. This
    character can be a space (' '), a star ('*'), or a signet ('-') to
    indicate that the annotations belonging to this given entry are all
    visible, all hidden, or partially visible, respectively.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong><br />
The <strong>Annotation Local Filter Menu</strong> dialog only shows you the
annotations it knows about at the moment it is opened. If new annotations are
added, you will need to reload the menu again.</p>

<p>The annotation author shows the author's name added to the name of the
annotation server where the annotation is stored.</p>

<h3 id="Navigating">Navigating annotations</h3>

<p>Annotations can be navigated by choosing <strong>Show Links</strong> from
the <span class="Link"><strong>Views</strong> menu</span>. The Link window
opens and displays a list of annotations. Annotations in the Link and
Document windows are marked with a pencil annotation icon.</p>

<h3 id="Annotation3">Annotations in the link window</h3>

<p>The Link window shows all the annotations, without taking into account
whether they have been hidden with <strong>Local filter</strong> on the
<strong>Annotations</strong> menu. As with the document window, a
single-click on the annotation selects the annotated text in the document
window and a double-click opens the annotation. This is an example of how to
navigate from one annotation link to another, even if the annotation cannot
be seen by the user because of disabilities or because of the characteristics
of the used device.</p>

<h3 id="Moving">Moving annotations</h3>

<p>You can move an annotation to any other part of the same document. This
can be used, for example, to handle <a href="#Known">orphan and misleading
annotations</a>. You can move an annotation to either the current selection
or to the value of a stored <span class="Link">XPointer</span>. It is only
possible to move annotations in the same document where they were created.</p>

<p>To move an annotation to a current selection:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <strong>Annotations</strong> menu and select <strong>Annotate
    document</strong>. The <strong>annotation</strong> window opens.</li>
  <li>Click the annotated document and select something on it.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>annotation</strong> window, choose <strong>Move to
    selection</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong> menu.</li>
  <li>Amaya moves the annotation icon to the text you selected and will mark
    the annotation document as modified.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make this change effective, must save the annotation or you will loose
the change. You can also move an annotation to the current position of the
cursor, without having to make a selection.</p>

<h3 id="Moving1">Moving annotations to a previously memorized location</h3>

<p>You can store the position where you want to move an annotation to, and
then move it there. This feature is useful for moving multiple annotations to
the same position or for scrolling elsewhere in the document before doing the
move.</p>

<p>To move multiple annotations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make a selection (or just place the cursor) in the location where you
    want to move the annotation.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Store selection as XPointer</strong> from the
    <strong>Annotations</strong> menu to store an XPointer representing that
    selection.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Annotations</strong> window, choose <strong>Move to
    stored XPointer</strong> from the <strong>Annotations</strong> menu to
    move the annotation to its new location.</li>
  <li>Save the annotation to make this change effective.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Replying">Replying to annotations / discussion threads</h3>

<p>Annotations can be seen as comments to pages. The <strong>Annotation /
Replies</strong> feature enhances the collaborative workspace by allowing
users to reply to annotations or to other replies.</p>

<p>The <strong>Annotations / Reply to annotation</strong> menu command lets
you to create a reply to an existing annotation or to a reply. You can invoke
this command from an open annotation or a reply window. As a result a new
reply window opens. The fields in a reply window can be edited just like in
an annotation window as explained under <strong>Creating an
annotation</strong>.</p>

<p>When the reply is ready, you can post it to a server with
<strong>Annotations / Post to Server</strong> menu command or save it locally
using the <strong>File / Save</strong> menu command. To delete a reply, you
can use the <strong>Annotations / Delete</strong> menu command.</p>

<p>Replies can also be annotated like any other document, as explained in <a
href="#Creating">Creating an annotation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="user">The user interface</h3>

<p>In the current user interface, all replies related to an annotation are
shown at the bottom of this annotation, in a thread section. Each item in the
thread gives the date of the reply, the author, and the title of the reply.
The content of any of these replies can be retrieved by double clicking the
replies in the thread. The selected reply will be highlighted and presented
in a reply window. When another selection is made the same reply window is
used.</p>

<h3 id="Known">Known issues: incomplete threads</h3>

<p>There is no control yet for controlling which replies should be posted. In
an ideal world, it should not be possible to save a reply to a reply if the
previous reply was not saved in the same server. Likewise, if you delete a
reply, you should delete all replies to this annotation. Not doing leads to
having fragments of threads that cannot be correctly attached in the thread.
For example, let R1 be the reply to annotation A1 and R2 a reply to R1. If
you post R1, and let R2 be stored locally, then when you browse A1 and only
download its local annotations, you will only see R2. At this point, Amaya
does not know that R1 exists, so it assumes that R2 has lost its parent. We
identify these "orphan" threads by putting a question mark symbol
<strong>?</strong> in front of them. If later one, Amaya finds new thread
items, for example, if you download R1, Amaya will then sort the thread view,
inserting the threads as appropriately. In our example, R2 will become a
child of R1, as expected.</p>

<h3 id="Configurin">Configuring annotation icons</h3>

<h4 id="User-defin">User-definable icons by Annotation type (aka "dynamic
icons")</h4>

<p>As of Release 6.2, the icon used to mark the location of an annotation
within an annotated document may be changed by the user.</p>

<p>In release 6.2 the icon that denotes an annotation is chosen as a property
of the annotation type. By including an RDF property of each annotation type
you wish to use, you select the icon associated with annotations of that
type.</p>

<p>The sample configuration that is shipped with release 6.2 associates the
following icons:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/advice.png" alt="Advice" /> </td>
      <td>Advice</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/change.png" alt="Change" /> </td>
      <td>Change</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/annot.png" alt="Comment" /> </td>
      <td>Comment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/example.png" alt="Example" /> </td>
      <td>Example</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/explanation.png" alt="Explanation"
        /> </td>
      <td>Explanation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/question.png" alt="Question" />
      </td>
      <td>Question</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="35"><img src="../../amaya/seealso.png" alt="SeeAlso" /> </td>
      <td>SeeAlso</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The property name for adding annotation icons is <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/typeIcon#usesIcon">http://www.w3.org/2001/10/typeIcon#usesIcon</a>.
For instance, to specify an icon named file:///home/question-icon.jpg for
annotations that have type <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Question">http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Question</a>
you would enter the following RDF/XML into a file that Amaya reads at startup
is:</p>
<pre>&lt;rdf:RDF
   xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:i = "http://www.w3.org/2001/10/typeIcon#"&gt;
&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Question"&gt;
  &lt;i:usesIcon rdf:resource="file:///home/question-icon.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre>

<p>The simplest way to get such RDF loaded into Amaya at startup is to
include the file in the config/annot.schemas file in the Amaya program
directory. In order to preserve this file so that it will not be overwritten
when you install a new version of Amaya, you should copy the
config/annot.schemas file into your personal Amaya home directory;
~/.amaya/annot.schemas (on Unix systems) or
/winnt/profiles/&lt;username&gt;/amaya/annot.schemas (on Microsoft Windows
systems). You may list as many RDF files as you want in annot.schemas. See
the comments in the file included in the Amaya kit for more details.</p>

<p>Release 6.2 includes a sample file named "typeIcon.rdf" that declares
unique icons for each annotation type declared in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#">http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#</a>
namespace. To experiment with user-defined icons, it may be easiest to copy
this typeIcon.rdf into another directory and modify it. Copy annot.schemas to
your Amaya home directory and change the line near the end to point to your
revised icon definition file.</p>

<p>To revert to the previous behavior prior to release 6.2, edit the
config/annot.schemas in the Amaya installation directory and add a comment
character ("#") at the beginning of the line near the end that refers to
typeIcon.rdf:</p>
<pre>#user-defined icons
#http://www.w3.org/2001/10/typeIcon# $THOTDIR/config/typeIcon.rdf</pre>

<p>Amaya supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF bitmap graphics formats for icon images.
In release 6.2 the icon URI may only be a file: URI; that is, the icon must
appear in a local or mounted directory to Amaya. Two special forms of
non-file: URIs are supported. If the file path name starts with "$THOTDIR" or
"$APP_HOME" then the corresponding Amaya installation directory or personal
Amaya home directory is substituted into the pathname.</p>

<h3 id="Known1">Known issues with annotations and modified documents</h3>

<p>When you use annotations with live documents (documents whose contents can
be modified), you may encounter two kinds of problems: <strong>orphan
annotations</strong> and <strong>misleading annotations</strong>. To explain
these problems, we must first describe how Amaya attaches annotations to
documents.</p>

<p>Amaya uses <strong><a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking">XPointer</a></strong> to indicate where
an annotation should be attached to a document. XPointers are based in the
structure of the document. To build an XPointer for a selection, for example,
Amaya starts from the first point of the selection and walk backwards through
the document's structure, until it finds the root of the document. If an
element has an ID attribute, Amaya stops building the XPointer and considers
the element with the ID attribute value to be the beginning of that
XPointer.</p>

<p>For example, if you look at the HTML source for this document, you'll
notice that this section is enclosed within a DIV element that has an ID
attribute with the value "Issues" Here's an extract of the source code:</p>
<pre>  &lt;div id="Issues"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Issues with ....&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are using...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amaya uses &lt;strong&gt;XPointer&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  ...
  &lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>This XPointer points to the second paragraph:
<code>xpointer(id("Issues")/p[2])</code></p>

<p>The above XPointer points to the second <code>p</code> element, from the
element parent having an ID attribute with value "Issues".</p>

<p>Note that the use of the ID attribute enables the document author to move
the entire reference by the XPointer to another location within the document,
without needing to update the XPointer. The XPointer does not depend on the
elements that precede it.</p>

<h4 id="Orphan">Orphan annotations</h4>

<p>An annotation becomes an "orphan" when it can no longer be attached to a
document, that is, when the XPointer does not resolve to any element in the
structure. This happens when a document's structure is modified. Amaya
displays a warning if it detects any orphan annotations while downloading a
set of annotations from an annotation server. All orphan annotations are
visible from the Links view and are associated with an icon that shows a
question mark superimposed on the annotation pencil <img
src="../images/annotorp.png" alt="Orphan annotation icon" /> .</p>

<h4 id="Misleading">Misleading annotations</h4>

<p>An annotation becomes "misleading" when it points to a wrong piece of
information. This problem is common when you annotate a portion of text that
may change. In the first release, Amaya does not warn the user if an
annotation is misleading. A future release may notify users of the potential
for an annotation to be misleading.</p>

<h4 id="What1">What can you do to avoid this?</h4>

<p>As the author of a document, try to use the <code>ID</code> attribute in
strategic places, for example, inside <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> and
<code>p</code> elements. For example:</p>
<pre>  &lt;p id="Amaya"&gt;Amaya uses...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>An XPointer that points to this paragraph is:
<code>xpointer(id("Amaya"))</code></p>

<p>Thus, the Xpointer will point to the same paragraph, regardless of its
position in the document's structure.</p>

<p>Amaya enables you to automatically associate with or remove an
<code>ID</code> attribute to/from a set of elements by choosing
<strong>Add/Remove ID</strong> from the <strong>Links</strong> menu.</p>
