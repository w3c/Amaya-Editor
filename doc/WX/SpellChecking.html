<h2>Checking Spelling in Amaya</h2>

<p>Amaya provides a multilingual spell checker, and selects the appropriate
language according to the <code>lang</code> attribute. The <code>lang</code>
attribute can be associated with any element in a document, even with a
single word, using the <a
href="Attributes.html"><strong>Attributes</strong></a> tool.</p>

<p>To spell check a document, choose <strong>Check spelling</strong> from the
<strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>

<h3>The Personal Dictionary</h3>

<p>When you register a new word, the spell checker creates or updates the
<b>user's personal dictionary</b>. A user's personal dictionary is located in
the <code>AmayaHome/dictionary.DCT</code> file. In read-write mode, the spell
checker employs the user dictionary when reviewing all documents, in addition
to the language-specific dictionaries. When you click the <strong>Skip
(+dic)</strong> and <strong>Replace (+dic)</strong> buttons in the
<strong>Spell checking</strong> dialog, the user dictionary is created if
does not exists and automatically updated by the spelling checker.</p>

<h3>The Spell Check Dialog</h3>

<p>The <strong>Check spelling</strong> option on the <strong>Edit</strong>
menu displays a dialog that enables you to choose parameters and interact
with the spell checker. These parameters are defined below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Spell Checking</strong> field displays incorrect words. The
    list of proposed corrections is displayed in the selector field located
    below the incorrect word. By default, Amaya selects the first proposed
    correction. To select another correction, simply click it. The selected
    correction is displayed below the selector field. This correction can be
    directly edited on the form. The correction is made when you click the
    <strong>Replace and next</strong> or <strong>Replace (+dic)</strong>
    buttons.<br />
    Note that you can perform the correction by double-clicking a proposed
    correction.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>language</strong> in which the correction is made is
    specified in the bottom left corner of the form. To change the language,
    apply a <code>lang</code> attribute to the text with the
    <strong>Attributes</strong> tool, and restart the spell-check
  procedure.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Ignore</strong> section tells the spell checker to ignore
    certain words, for example, words that contain only capital letters,
    words that contain digits, Roman numerals or words with special
    characters (you can choose the special characters).
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Checking</strong> section, similar to that in the <a
    href="Searching.html">Search dialog</a>, enables you to specify the part
    of document on which the checker will work.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Running the Spell Checker</h3>

<p>To start the checker, click the <strong>Search/Skip</strong> button at the
bottom of the form. If an error is found, the incorrect word is selected and
highlighted in the document. If no error was detected, Amaya displays a
pop-up "End of spell checking".</p>

<p>When an incorrect word is detected, you can use a button on the form to
perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Search/Skip</strong>: Amaya considers the incorrect word as
    acceptable. No change is made in the text or in the dictionaries. The
    checker searches for the next error.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Skip (+dic)</strong>: Performs the same action as the
    <strong>Skip/Skip</strong> button, except that the word considered
    incorrect is added to the document dictionary, and the checker will
    ignore any subsequent occurrence of this word.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Replace and next</strong>: Amaya replaces the incorrect word
    with the correct word (optionally edited by the user) and the checker
    searches for the next error.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Replace (+dic):</strong> Performs the same action as the
    <strong>Replace and next</strong> button, except that the replacement
    word is added to the document dictionary.</li>
  <li><strong>Cancel</strong>: Amaya closes the form and stops spell
    checking. Previous corrections are not canceled.</li>
</ul>
