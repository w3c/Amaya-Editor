<h2 id="Support">XML Support</h2>

<h3 id="Loading">Loading XML documents</h3>

<p>Amaya can display any well formed XML document and associate a CSS
stylesheet with these documents.</p>

<p>For an XML document that refers to a not-supported DTD or namespace
(different from XHTML, MathML and SVG), Amaya offers a limited support for
the display and for the edition. Indeed, as Amaya doesn't analyse the
associated DTD, it can't verify the validity of any XML document and can't
get specific information about elements and attributes and about their
organization within the document.</p>

<h3 id="Using">Using style in XML</h3>

<p>If the document is associated to a DTD that Amaya does not understand, the
content of the document will be formatted and displayed in a way that
reflects the structure of the document. If there is no style indication, the
content of each element will be shown as a <strong>block</strong>. However,
for clarity, the elements that have at least one child of type "Text" are
considered to be of type <em>inline</em> and displayed accordingly. Amaya can
use associate a CSS style sheet. You can also modify the presentation of the
document if you associate a CSS style sheet to it by means of a <strong><a
href="http://www.w3.org/1999/06/REC-xml-stylesheet-19990629/">xml-stylesheet
PI</a></strong> (processing instruction) statement.</p>

<h3 id="Editing">Editing XML documents</h3>

<p>The edition of generic XML documents in Amaya is still experimental. For
the supported samples (XHTML, SVG, MathML), the edition follows the same
rules as for the corresponding document type. For the other elements, only
the <kbd>Enter</kbd> command is available in this version :</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the selection is within an element, Amaya cuts the selected element
    and creates a new element with the same type next to it.</li>
  <li>If a whole non-empty element is selected, Amaya creates a new element
    with the same type next to the selected element.</li>
  <li>If a whole empty element is selected, Amaya creates a sibling with the
    same type for the parent of the selected element.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also edit your XML documents in the <strong>Source view</strong>
and use the <strong>Resynchronize</strong> command. Your modifications are
then reported in the formatted view.</p>
