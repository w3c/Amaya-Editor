<h2 id="Using">Using Image and Maps</h2>

<h3 id="Adding">Adding an Image</h3>

<p>To <em>insert</em> an image, choose <strong>Image</strong> from the
<strong>XHTML</strong> menu, click the <strong>Image</strong> <img
src="../../resources/icons/16x16/XHTML_Image.png" alt="Image button" />
button, or use the keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl h</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl i</kbd>).
The resulting dialog lets you enter the file name and alternative text
(<strong>Alt</strong> attribute) of the desired image.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: the alternative text is mandatory. You
must provide some text in the corresponding field.</p>

<p>To help find an image file you can enter a filter field, and use the
filter button, and the dialog will list only the files that match your
pattern.</p>

<p>To provide a long description for an image presenting complex information,
you should do so in a separate document and link it by giving the URI as a
<strong>longdesc</strong>. This command is also available on the
<strong>Attributes</strong> list.</p>

<h3 id="Replacing">Replacing an Image</h3>

<p>If an image is selected (do so by dragging over the image) when opening
the image dialog, the selected image is then <em>replaced</em> by the new
image.</p>

<h3 id="About">About Alternative Text and Long Descriptions</h3>

<p>Without useful alternative text for images, many web pages become
difficult or even impossible to navigate, and users are left "feeling their
way in the dark."</p>

<p>To prevent this problem, you must provide alternative text for elements
such as images and other multimedia objects. The alternative text is usually
presented instead of the image by a browser with a voice output system, or on
a Braille display used by many people who are blind. It is also common for
users with low-quality connections to request the alternate view, because
text is transmitted much faster than images.</p>

<p>The alternative text should replace the image in function as well. For
example, if you use the image as an icon that links to a reference point,
then the title of the reference itself is a good alternative text.</p>

<p>There are cases where an image is used for purely visual effect, and does
not add any information value to the page. In this case, it is appropriate to
use a blank alternative text, although you must still define it.</p>

<p>When the image conveys important information that is not available from
the text of the document, you must provide a description of the information.
The <code>longdesc</code> option in the <strong>Attributes</strong> list
enables you to link a description to the image. This description can be a URI
(a separate document), or named part of the current document.</p>

<p>To view how a page might be presented without the images, use Show
Alternate (<span class="Link0"><strong>Views &gt;Show
Alternate</strong></span>). If the page is spoken by a voice output system,
then the alternate view might simply be read out.</p>

<h3 id="Using1">Using client-side image maps</h3>

<p>Amaya enables you to use client-side image maps.</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To activate an area in an image map</p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click on the area within the image. Amaya finds the URI
    associated to this area, and opens it in the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To display the existing areas within an image
map</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <strong>Show Map Areas</strong> from the <strong>Views</strong>
    menu.<br />

    <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong>   You can also display existing
    areas directly from the keyboard by clicking <kbd>Ctrl u
    Ctrl</kbd><kbd>t</kbd>.</p>
