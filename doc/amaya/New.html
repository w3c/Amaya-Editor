the most recent versions of Amaya.</P>
<H1>New features in Amaya 0.95b</H1>
<P><EM>January 9, 1996</EM></P>
<H2>Extensions</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Attributes height and width are taken into account for IMG, TD and TH.
<LI>Tooltips (aka tips) are available on buttons.
<LI>A message is displayed at the bottom of the window when the document
is saved.
<LI>Creation of definition lists (DL) is easier.
<LI>Two new buttons, to create links and tables.

</UL>
<H2>Fixed bugs</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The main view (Formatted_view) of HTML documents was always placed
at the top left corner of the screen. The position specified in the
HTML.conf file was ignored.
<LI>Under certain conditions, it was possible to create several BODY or
HEAD elements in the same document.
<LI>It was sometimes necessary to activate the Close View command twice for
actually closing the Structure view.
<LI>In some tables, columns containing badly structured cells were sometimes
moved to the left side of the table.
<LI>When an image was within a paragraph with some text, and with a caret
on its right or left edge, pressing keys Enter, Del and BackSpace led
to strange results.
<LI>Submitting a form always sent the value attribute of the Submit button,
regardless of whether a name attribute was present or not. Other minor
problems with form selection were fixed up.
<LI>Amaya didn't support invalid base like a complete document URL.
<LI>Amaya didn't support invalid attributes in BASE element.
<LI>Under certain conditions, copy and paste of images between documents
didn't work.

</UL>
<H1>New features in Amaya 0.9</H1>
<P><EM>November 14, 1996</EM></P>
<H2>Extensions</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Structure transformation (command Types/Transform)
<UL>
<LI>more efficient pattern matching algorithm
<LI>more structure checking: transformations are not proposed to the user if
they lead to an invalid structure (even if the transformation is matched with
the selection).
<LI>the last modification time of the file <CODE>HTML.trans</CODE> is checked
before it is parsed.
<LI>in version 0.8, if the parser detects an error in file
<CODE>HTML.trans</CODE>, the transformation process is stopped. Now, the
parser skips the invalid transformation.
<LI>error messages are displayed at the bottom of the window.
</UL>
<LI>Color palette
<UL>
<LI>The palette highlights the foreground and background colors of the element
selected when the palette is opened. The highlight allows users to choose the
same colors for different elements.
<LI>It is also possible now to remove a color attribute from an element just
using the "standard color" button in the palette.
</UL>
<LI>Forms
<UL>
<LI>forms can now be sent using GET and POST methods to protected/unprotected
URLs
<LI>creation of form components has been improved
<LI>you can  activate buttons and menu options by double-clicking them.
</UL>
<LI>HTML 3.2
<UL>
<LI>the latest extensions of HTML 3.2. have been added: tag BASEFONT and
attributes width and height for tags TH and TD.
<LI>It is now possible to add comments in HTML documents (use command
Structure/Comment in the Structure view)
</UL>
<LI>User Interface
<UL>
<LI>When the current selection is within a PRE element, some menu entries are
disabled: Image in Types menu, and Big, Small, Sub, Sup, and Font in Character
Element menu.
<LI>Interpretation of "~" and "file:" in "Open" and "Save As" dialogue boxes
<LI>In previous versions, I B and TT buttons were never updated when selection
changed. Now they are displayed according to the current selection.
<LI>Continuous scroll: the document scrolls as you move the slider
<LI>Distinction between "Cancel" and "Done" buttons in dialogue boxes.
<LI>When opening the Structure view, the document is displayed with the
selected part visible in that view.
</UL>
<LI>Environment variables are initialized from the Registry (file
<CODE>thot.ini</CODE>)
<LI>Integration of libwww5.0a, giving among other things: HTTP/1.1 and
keep-alive connections.
<LI>Reload button and command (File/Reload Document).
<LI>Spell checker is now available for English and French, but both
dictionaries are far from complete.
</UL>
<H2>Bug fixes</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Closing an Amaya window with a window manager command caused Amaya to
crash. Now only the concerned window is closed.
<LI>The HTML parser inserted a space at the beginning of a new line generated
by a &lt;BR> tag followed by new line in the source file.
<LI>Call "Change link" from Links menu and click in the document itself. The
dialog box for entering the URL of the target was empty in previous versions.
Now it contains the current value of attribute HREF.
<LI>Select some characters, call "Create link" from Link menu and click in the
document itself. Do not enter anything in the dialogue box for the URL and
press the Cancel button in this dialogue box. Later, call the Change link
command for entering an actual URL for that anchor. Nothing happened in
previous versions. Now you can change the URL.
<LI>Some elements were lost during structure transformation, this is now
fixed.
<LI>Structure transformation was impossible if the selection contains comments
or invalid elements. Now transformations are possible (invalid tags are
removed in the new structure).
<LI>In previous versions, if the input focus is in one window and you press
the H1 button (or any other button of that kind) in another window (with a
different document in it) it changes the first window. Now, the button does
nothing.
<LI>Colors management is completely re-casted and we hope to solve color
problems in previous versions.
<LI>An emphasized string (or strong or...) can now span several lines in a
Preformatted.
<LI>When the same Web image is shared by two loaded documents, just one local
copy was created by Amaya and this copy was lost when the first document was
closed. This choice causes troubles when user tried to publish the second
document. Now Amaya creates two copies, one for each document.
<LI>Copy and paste on images didn't work fine in previous release.
<LI>Sometimes, local copies of remote documents were not created in the right
place. Now it works.
<LI>When user closed a document view with the Window Manager, the whole
application exited. Now only the document view is closed.
<LI>It is now possible to save a document if it is modified and close it.
<LI>In the previous version, Amaya did not detect the cancel of the network
save of an object to a protected URL space.
<LI>Inserting an image from a local directory did not react well to errors.
This has been corrected.
<LI>Call "Create Link" when an target anchor is selected or "Create Target"
when a link anchor is selected, Amaya refused to add the href or name
attribute. Now it works.
<LI>Call "Change Link" anywhere asked to select the destination. Now this
function works only within an link anchor.
<LI>After loading a lot of CSS files Amaya cannot load images because file
descriptors are not freed. Now it is correct.
<LI>The command "Save As" doesn't work or crashes. Now it is correct.
<LI>Bug in area-mapping (circle) fixed.
<LI>Support of the starting option -display
<LI>If a user gave a wrong password, Amaya did not ask the user for the new
password. It kept using the wrong one. Fixed.
<LI>When typing in the WYSIWYG window, clicking e.g. the "Italics" button
enters italics mode. After typing a few italic chars one wants to change back
to normal mode. Clicking the "Italics" button once again achieves this. But
you can't go on typing in normal mode, because this second click also selects
the italic text to become the active (highlighted) region. Simply typing ahead
overwrites the whole (italic) region. This bug is fixed.
<LI>The implicit break following the &lt;HR>failed to appear when a
&lt;FONT><FONT> tag follows &lt;BR>. The text within the FONT construct
appeared to the right ofthe horizontal rule.  This bug is fixed</FONT>
<LI><FONT>When typing in the WYSIWYG window, clicking e.g. the "Italics"
button enters italics mode. After typing a few italic chars one wants to
change back to normal mode. Clicking the "Italics" button once again achieves
this. But you can't go on typing in normal mode, because this second click
also selects the italic text to become the active (highlighted) region. Simply
typing ahead overwrites the whole (italic) region. This bug is fixed.</FONT>
<LI><FONT>Printing with "US" paper size did not work. Bug fixed.</FONT>
<LI><FONT>When changing attribut "align" for an element DIV containing
paragraphs, the paragraphs were not redisplayed with the alignment defined by
the attribute but they moved in a weird way in the Structure view. This bug is
fixed. </FONT>
<LI>Select a DT and change its style: the DT element in the Structure view
gets confused. Bug fixed.
<LI>Selection was moved to its original position at the ned of command
Edit/Find. It now stays at its current position.
