<h2><a name="L125">I.1. Is <b>Amaya</b> an editor or a browser?</a></h2>

<p><b>Amaya</b> is mainly an authoring tool with browser features.  Link
management and remote publishing are important features in a hypertext editor,
and these features require seamless integration with browsing features.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Where">I.2. Where can I get <b>Amaya</b>?</a></h2>

<p>You can download the <b>Amaya</b> distribution in various formats, and you
can use either ftp or http:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>The page at <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html</a>
    gives access to a ready to use application for various platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The page at <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html</a>
    gives access to the source code.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Amaya1">I.3. Is Amaya available for MacOS?</a></h2>

<p>Currently, Amaya is available for various Unix and Windows platforms. We
don't have the resources for supporting additional platforms, but the source
code is available and contributions to a port are welcome.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="release">I.4. Can I release Amaya on a CD-ROM?</a></h2>

<p>Yes, and you can even charge for it, provided the copyright is
preserved.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="make">I.5. Can I make some changes and re-release it?</a></h2>

<p>Yes, we encourage people to experiment with Amaya and to improve it. It can
even be used in commercial software. If you make changes for the better, we
encourage you to contact us. You may<em> not</em> make changes and continue to
call it by a trademarked term or misrepresent the origin, capabilities, or
liabilities associated with its use. You may make valid assertions, such that
it is based on the Amaya code, or that it is compliant with a Recommended
Specification of the W3C.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="L147">I.6. Why is <b>Amaya</b> written in C?</a></h2>

<p>C has a number of advantages that fit well with our purposes. It's a very
portable and efficient language. Amaya is also based on a pre-existing editing
library, the Thotlib, which was itself written in C. It was natural to
continue to develop the Amaya code in C.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="I.7.">I.7. <b>Is Amaya Y2K compliant</b>?</a></h2>

<p>Yes <b>Amaya</b> is Y2K compliant.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Amaya">II.1 Is Amaya compliant with MathML?</a></h2>

<p>Yes, but the current implementation of MathML 1.0 in Amaya is not complete
yet. The Amaya documentation clearly indicates what is available. See section
"Current limitations" in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Math.html">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Math.html</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="edit">II.2. Can I edit tags directly?</a></h2>

<p>Amaya has been built as a structured document editor.  This approach allows
it to handle complex documents and highly structured objects such as tables,
structured graphics or mathematical expressions. While editing in the  HTML or
the XHML mode, Amaya works on the document tree, not on its textual
representation, which is generated only at save time, in the syntax you choose
(plain text, HTML, XHML).</p>

<p>Amaya also allows you to open the source view of the document and then to
edit tags. This is done in a separate but synchronized document. Amaya shows
what part of the source document is concerned by the current selection in the
formatted document and conversely. Both the source document and the formatted
document can be edited.  Changes done in any of these two documents are
reflected in the other by the <code>File/Synchronize</code> command.
Synchronization is also performed automatically when the document is saved
from either wiew.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Displayed">II.3. Fonts are too small. What can I do?</a></h2>

<p>With Amaya you can zoom in and zoom out, document window by document
window. So each document displayed in a zoomed window will be displayed larger
or smaller than its normal size according of the current zoom factor. That
zoom factor acts on all the displayed information (fonts, images, etc.).
Commands that chage the zoom factor are located in the menu Views.</p>

<p>The <em>Special/Preferences/General</em> menu allows you to change the font
zoom factor permanently. By default that zoom factor is 0 (documents are
displayed with their own size). That zoom factor affects only font sizes but
not other elements (images, etc.).</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="XFonts">II.4. Can I  get fonts for Amaya on linux?</a></h2>

<p>There are interesting X fonts for  linux at: <a
href="http://www.gimp.org/urw-fonts.tar.gz">http://www.gimp.org/urw-fonts.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<p>To install them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Untar the file into /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts</li>
  <li>Change the file /etc/X11/XF86Config :
    <pre> Section "Files"
 RgbPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/URW"
 FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
 FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"
 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
 EndSection</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Restart your X server and you will have a better display with
  Amaya.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="want">II.5. How can I change the default window size</a></h2>

<p>Resize your window to the value you'd like, then use the
Special/Preference/Geometry menu to save the current geometry of the displayed
windows. Your modifications won' be lost the next time that Amaya is
updated.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="parsing">II.6. Can I see parsing errors detected by
Amaya?</a></h2>

<p>Amaya cannot be used to check documents validity. It accepts valid and
invalid documents and tries to dynamically correct detected errors. For
example it's able to add missing end-tags and to move misplaced elements.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when Amaya find invalid tags and invalid attributes it
generates a log file which can be displayed by the command <em>Special/Show
log file</em>.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="What">II.7. What is the reason</a> for a very liberal structure
enforcement?</h2>

<p>Amaya has to cope with existing Web pages, and very few of them validate
against the HTML DTD. When designing Amaya, we were faced with a difficult
choice:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Adopt a strict position and reject all invalid pages. Most users would
    be very disapointed not to be able to see many pages that     other Web
    clients can display;</li>
  <li>Accept invalid pages and let Amaya fix the most common bugs.</li>
</ol>

<p>We took the latest position and decided that Amaya should try to fix bugs,
but without losing information.  If an element is not valid in a given
context, Amaya tries to change the structure locally to make that element
valid, but it doesn't delete the element or move it to a different place,
which could change its meaning.</p>

<p>The issue is that a DTD only specifies the structure of a document class,
not its semantics.  When you consider an invalid document, there are often
several ways to transform its structure to make it valid, but each
transformation may have a different impact on the document semantics. The DTD
does not allow you to choose the right transformation.</p>

<p>Another important design decision that has been made for Amaya is that,
even if it accepts invalid documents, the structure and markup that it
produces is always valid. Obviously, only elements created or changed by Amaya
itself are concerned here. Some invalid parts of the original document may
remain when the document is saved.</p>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="II.7.">II.8. How can I update the document title?</a></h2>

<p>The document title as any head element can to  be edited in the Structure
view of the document. The user can also use the dialogue entry Types/Change
Title.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Where3">III.1. Where can I get the developer's
documentation</a></h2>

<p>Those who want to extend or change the Amaya application need to read the
following documentation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html">Amaya
    architecture.</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/APIman.toc.html">Thot API
    manual</a> explains how the Thotlib works and gives the list of available
    functions</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Appman.toc.html">Thot
    Application generation manual</a> explains how to generate menus and the
    mechanism of Thot events.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/languages.toc.html">Thot
    language manual</a> gives the syntax of the S, P and T languages.</li>
  <li>The page <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Amaya-dev.html">Amaya-dev.html</a>
    gives team conventions for writing the Thotlib and the Amaya code.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Make">III.2. Make complains with missing files</a></h2>

<p>This error occurs when one forgot to create the object subtree before
launching the configure process. As explained in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html">Autoconf page</a>, you have
to create first a subtree (<em>obj</em> or any other name)  for object code
and launch configure to create the Makefile(s):</p>
<pre>cd Amaya</pre>
<pre>mkdir obj </pre>
<pre>cd obj</pre>
<pre> ../configure</pre>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Make1">III.3. Make fails when compiling the HTML schema</a></h2>

<p>Thot compilers need a <strong>cpp</strong> preprocessor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you use GNU tools, configure should invoke the gcc compiler with the
    right options. You can check that file <em>Options</em> contains the
    following definition:
    <pre>CPP     = gcc -E -x c</pre>
  </li>
  <li>In other cases you have to make sure that the <strong>cpp</strong>
    preprocessor is in your PATH.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="don't">III.4. I don't have Motif</a></h2>

<p>The Amaya user interface is based on OSF/Motif, and Motif is not freely
available on Linux. You can use <a href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a>
(a free Motif clone) instead. Amaya works fine with the latest versions (0.8.0
and later) of <a href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a>.</p>
