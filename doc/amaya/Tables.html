<h2>Editing tables</h2>
<p>
There is no separate table editor in <strong>Amaya</strong>. A table is simply
a structure described by the HTML DTD and it is edited as such. The same
commands apply to tables as to other HTML structures.</p>
<p>
Tables can be created very efficiently with the <a
href="Creating.html#L906">Return key</a>. Create a one-cell table with the
table button or the <strong>Table</strong> entry from the
<strong>Types</strong> menu. The space above the table is reserved for the
caption. Move the insertion point to the new cell. Type in the content of that
cell ("Cell 1.1" in the example below). Create a second cell by hitting the
Return key twice (the first hit creates a paragraph in the first cell). To
create a new row, press Return three times. To create a new
<code>tbody</code>, press Return four times, etc.</p>

<table border="1">
<caption>Caption</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 1.1
</td>
<td>
Cell 1.2
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Cell 2.1
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
When you have built the previous table by creating 3 cells, Amaya have had
automatically generated an empty cell (future Cell 2.2). You can click on it
and insert text. You can also move to this empty cell by using arrow keys.
When the selection is at the end of the text "Cell 2.1", you can create a new
column between Cell 2.1 and the empty cell by pressing Return key twice.</p>
<p>
There is no specific command to create or delete a column. When you create a
new cell, Amaya generates a new column and when you delete a cell in a column
that becomes empty, Amaya deletes the column.</p>
<p>
Note that the table model implemented in <strong>Amaya</strong> is the <a
href="../../TR/REC-html40">HTML&nbsp;4.0</a> model. This includes features
such as multiple bodies (<code>tbody</code>), header (<code>thead</code>) and
footer (<code>tfoot</code>).</p>
